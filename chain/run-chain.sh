# run-chain.sh - reference orchestration for the NuClide assessment chain.
#
# This is the REFERENCE runner, not the spec. The canonical chain definition
# (the eight stages, what VERIFY means, the restraint ethic) lives in
# docs/METHODOLOGY.md. Read that first. This script just wires public tools
# together in the documented order so you can see the shape of a real run.
#
# WHAT SHIPS WITH THIS REPO: nothing operational. No credentials, no target
# list, no ledger, no scan output. You supply the scope. You supply the keys.
# The script reads a scoped IP-list file you pass as the first argument and
# refuses to run without it.
#
# Public tools the chain calls (install these yourself, see chain/README.md):
#   aimap, tome, herald, bare, tiptoe, scanner   (NuClide public tools)
#   nmap, nuclei, httpx, naabu                    (established tools)
#
# Private or local helpers the full internal chain uses are STUBBED here and
# clearly marked "documented gap". Provide your own, or see the methodology
# docs for what the stage is meant to produce, then continue.
#
# Usage:
#   chain/run-chain.sh <scoped-ip-list> [slug]
#
#   <scoped-ip-list>  Path to a file you own, one IP[:port] per line. Required.
#                     This file is YOUR scope. The repo ships no such file.
#   [slug]            Short label for the run (output dir + tags). Default: run.
#
# Output goes to a per-run directory under ${NUCLIDE_OUT:-./nuclide-runs}.
